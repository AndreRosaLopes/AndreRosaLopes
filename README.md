### My personal portfolio ðŸ‘‹

I am a dedicated engineer with a passion for providing data-driven advice to meet business objectives. Currently, I am focused on expanding my technical expertise (recently achieving MS Power BI certification and building a solid foundation in SQL).

This GitHub repository serves as a showcase for my portfolio. I a lot of data analysis as a satellite engineer (mostly with Python, uploading results as applications), all are under NDA. I'm going to share non-confidential work here soon. :)

- SQL olist data base (adapted)
This is a public and open source data base from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/sepidehsoleimanian/olist-project).

The objective of this project is:
1) setting a SQL data base (currently, I'm using postgreSQL) - Done;
2) applying SQL skill learned from a few courses of SQL; and
3) Maybe use PowerBI and python( with panel) to show some reports (apps).


- Example of viz (with python/panel/bokeh):

_In this example, I processed a large amount of data (time series), summarizing hourly charts for each month into a single "bar." In the visualization, we have a comparison of a quality metric for "two services" (blue and yellow) and their evolution over the months. This report had filters, to select the service area._
