# Who I am?
I am a Data Engineer with expertise in ETL/ELT processes, data integration, and dimensional modeling, leveraging tools such as Databricks, IBM DataStage and SQL.

I help organizations transform raw data into valuable insights through reliable modeling, transformation, and enrichment â€” always with a focus on quality and integrity. ðŸ˜Š

# Welcome to my portfolio ðŸ‘‹

## 1. Databricks â€“ [Basic Retail Project](https://github.com/AndreRosaLopes/DATABRICKS_basic_ETL/blob/main/README.md)

The goal of this project is to explore and evaluate key Databricks capabilities through a retail sales use case.  
The scope includes:

- Developing notebooks using **SQL**, **Python**, and **Delta Live Tables** (declarative pipelines)  
- Managing data updates with **day-level precision** (movement control)  
- Implementing **CI/CD** workflows â€” including unit tests, integration tests, and **GitHub Actions** automation  
- Exploring **metadata-driven pipelines** for flexible and configurable data ingestion
