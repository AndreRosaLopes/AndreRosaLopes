### My personal portfolio ðŸ‘‹

I am a dedicated engineer with a passion for providing data-driven advice to meet business objectives. Currently, I am focused on expanding my technical expertise (recently achieving MS Power BI certification and building a solid foundation in SQL).

This GitHub repository serves as a showcase for my portfolio. I a lot of data analysis as a satellite engineer at Telebras (most with Python, uploading results as applications), all are under NDA. I'm going to share non-confidential work here soon. :)
