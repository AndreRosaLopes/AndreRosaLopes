# My personal portfolio ðŸ‘‹
## Who I am?
I am a dedicated engineer with a passion for providing data-driven advice to meet business objectives. Currently, I am focused on expanding my technical expertise (recently achieving MS Power BI certification and building a solid foundation in SQL).
## Objective
This GitHub repository serves as a showcase for my portfolio. I made a lot of data analysis as a satellite engineer (mostly with Python, uploading results as on line reports / apps), but all are under NDA. I'm going to share non-confidential work here soon. :)

## 1. [SQL](https://github.com/AndreRosaLopes/SQL_public_portfolio)
- SQL olist data base from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sepidehsoleimanian/olist-project).

a) [Project #1](https://github.com/AndreRosaLopes/SQL_public_portfolio/blob/main/Creating%20the%20data%20base%20olist.pgsql): ETL with postgreSQL
This is how the Entity Relationship Diagram looks like:

b) applying SQL skill learned from a few courses of SQL; and
c) Maybe use PowerBI and python( with panel) to show some reports (apps).

## 2. Python
- Example of viz (with python/panel/bokeh):

_In this example, I processed a large amount of data (time series), summarizing hourly charts for each month into a single "bar." In the visualization, we have a comparison of a quality metric for "two services" (blue and yellow) and their evolution over the months. This report had filters, to select the service area._
